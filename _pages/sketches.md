Here are a few of my amateur sketches that I especially like.

*  [Lazy Rudy](https://youtu.be/R1bYJBwsUFI): Rudy doesn't let his limited drive get in the way of his success.

*  [Baseball](https://youtu.be/ssZvdahgOFs): Everyone else succeeds more than the protagonist of a kid's baseball movie.
* [Our Place in the Stars](https://youtu.be/nCuEoNhsdD8): A retrospective on the failed true intention of the moon landing.
* [Willy Wonka and the 3M Factory](https://youtu.be/-1nfJWJEzGA): An alternate universe where kids are excited to visit the 3M factory.
* [Mood Ringz](https://youtu.be/zeYEuq33-EQ): An advertisement for mood rings with dire consequences for one wearer.

* [Real People, Not Actors](https://youtu.be/5DYPaI7nE3M): My most successful video in terms of views, a parody of a national advertising campaign.
* [Childhood Sweethearts](https://youtu.be/1yvHd8QFa-U): Childhood sweethearts deal with one of them outgrowing the other.
